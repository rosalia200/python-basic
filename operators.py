#   *   multiplication
#   **  power
#   %   modolus - finds reminder

# comparison operators - boolean
#   < >

#  == - equality operator

# copmarison opeerators are used with conditional(if) statements
# logical operators
#   and - all conditions must be true
#         true and false = false
#
#   or  - atleast one condition must be true
#         true and false = true
#    not - negates conditions
# print(not(True or False and False))
